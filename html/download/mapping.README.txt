The mapping files consist of a tab-separated table that indicates which external protein, gene or small molecule identifiers in the source database were mapped to Reactome pathway annotations.

The columns within the mappings files follow a similar format:

Column 1) Source database identifier, e.g. UniProt, ENSEMBL Gene or ChEBI identifier
Column 2) Reactome Pathway Stable identifier
Column 3) URL
Column 4) Pathway Name
Column 5) Evidence Code
Column 6) Species

Our goal with these mapping files is to map the source database identifier to the lowest level pathway diagram or subset of the pathway.
