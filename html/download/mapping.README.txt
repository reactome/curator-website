The mapping files consist of a tab-separated table that indicates which external protein, gene or small molecule identifiers in the source database were mapped to Reactome pathway annotations. Our goal with distributing two sets of files for each different identifier type is to provide these mapping files link the source database identifier to: i) the lowest level pathway diagram or subset of the pathway, and ii) all level pathway diagrams (filename appended with 'All_Levels').

The columns within the mappings files follow a similar format:

Column 1) Source database identifier, e.g. UniProt, ENSEMBL or ChEBI identifier
Column 2) Reactome Pathway Stable identifier
Column 3) URL
Column 4) Pathway Name
Column 5) Evidence Code
Column 6) Species
